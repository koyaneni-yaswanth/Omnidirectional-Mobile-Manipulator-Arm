## Project Overview

The **Omnidirectional-Mobile-Manipulator-Arm** project aims to develop a versatile robotic arm mounted on an omnidirectional mobile platform. The project involves the following key components:

1. **Forward and Inverse Kinematics Simulations**: Performed in MATLAB to ensure accurate movement and positioning of the robotic arm.
2. **3D Printing**: Utilized Fusion 360 software to design and print the components of the robotic arm.

## Features

- **Forward Kinematics**: Calculations to determine the end-effector position based on given joint parameters.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Computations to find the joint parameters needed for the end-effector to reach a specific position.
- **3D Model Design**: Detailed CAD models created using Fusion 360.
- **3D Printing**: Instructions and files for printing the components of the robotic arm.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Omnidirectional-Mobile-Manipulator-Arm.git
    cd Omnidirectional-Mobile-Manipulator-Arm
    ```

2. **Install MATLAB**:
    - Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

3. **Install Fusion 360**:
